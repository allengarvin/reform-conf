How to make use of these files.

You'll need the Reform disassembler. You can get a copy at IFarchive:

It's written in Haskell, and that presents a slight problem, as it's
written for an old version of Haskell, namely 6.2 (the current version 
I have installed on Debian is 7.6.3, and it bails from errors). So you'll
need to find and compile the older release. If you're on Linux and have
32-bit libraries installed, there's a binary version at the above link,
which makes it a lot easier.

It doesn't work for some newer versions of the ZMachine. I made some
modifications some years back to get it to work with z6 games, but 
I've lost the source (I still have the binary). If I ever get some
real free time (ha ha ha!) maybe I'll learn some Haskell again and update
it for a newer release. I have some other features I want to add....

I also have some hacky scripts for generating source, but they're a mix
of shell and Pike scripts. Someday I'll rewrite them into Makefiles,
maybe.
